	%\subsection{Behavioral Experiment}
	%Good psychophysical relation between $\alpha$-value and rating. Positive slope shows that participants are in agreement with GANalyze, therefore we argue that using GANalyze to study the aesthetic properties of images is justified.
	
	%Steep curve represents good stimulus representation


	%\subsubsection{Visual Definitions}
	%Images here
	
	%\subsection{GANalyze Parameters}
	%st2
	
	% Interesting follow-up question: Would turning up parameters like brightness, saturation etc result in the same effect? Or has the GAN learned a specific way of applying these parameters?
