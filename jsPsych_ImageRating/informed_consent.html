  <h2 style=text-align:top;>Welcome to the study</h2>
    <p>In this task, you will be presented with two similar looking images produced by a neural network.
    Your task is to indicate which of the two images you find more aesthetically pleasing. You indicate this with the key on your keyboard corresponding to the location of your preferred image. 
    <p><i>Example:</i></p>
  <div id="images">
    <img src='stimuli/cat15_seed0_img100.jpg' style=padding-right:200px;></img>
    <img src='stimuli/cat15_seed0_img160.jpg'></img>
  </div>
<p><u>If you prefer image on the <i>left</i>, you press the letter <b>F</b> on your keyboard. If you prefer the image on the <i>right</i>, you press the letter <b>J</b>.</u></p>
Please note that the images presented here are not intended to be artistic photography. They are derived from everyday pictures that you can find on the internet. 
Do not expect images of world-class artworks or aesthetically intriguing images, they are mostly ordinary images. 
In addition, in some pairs the difference between the two versions of the image will be very small (perhaps even almost impossible to see), while in other pairs the difference may be more obvious. 
In all cases, try to pick the one that you prefer at first glance or with some level of scrutiny, as you wish. 
<p>If you press at random during the whole experiment or provide irrational data in another way, your submission will be <b>rejected</b> and you will <b>not</b> get paid.</p>
<p>The duration of this study is <b>10 minutes</b> with a short break at the 5 minute mark, after which it will automatically end.</p>
