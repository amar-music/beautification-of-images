  <h2 style=text-align:top;>Welcome to the study</h2>
    <p>In this task, you will be presented with two similar looking images created by a generative adversarial network (GAN).
    In each trial, one of the two images is the <i>base</i> image, while the other is the GANâ€™s attempt to create a more/less beautiful version of the base image.
    In order to validate whether the GAN truly has some understanding of what it means for an image to contain aesthetic value, 
    this study will test whether human participants tend to agree with the GAN on which image is more beautiful.
    Your task is to indicate which of the two images you believe is more aesthetic. You indicate this with the key on your keyboard corresponding to the location of your preferred image. 
    <p><i>Example:</i></p>
  <div id="images">
    <img src='stimuli/cat1_seed2_img100.jpg' style=padding-right:200px;></img>
    <img src='stimuli/cat1_seed2_img160.jpg'></img>
  </div>
<p><u>If you prefer image on the <i>left</i>, you press the letter <b>F</b> on your keyboard. If you prefer the image on the <i>right</i>, you press the letter <b>J</b>.</u></p>
Because this study aims to test the GAN's understanding of aesthetics, it is important that you pick the image that you really feel is more beautiful, and not just what you expect the GAN to produce. 
There are no right or wrong answers. In some trials the images will be nearly identical, but even here you will have to make a choice. Try not to overthink it, just go with your gut feeling.
<p>The duration of this study is <b>10 minutes</b>, after which it will automatically end.</p>
